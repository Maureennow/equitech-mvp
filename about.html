        <h2>Meet the Founder</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Nwamaka Maureen Ndubuisi</strong> created EquiTech Learning
          Hub with a vision to merge equity and technology in education. Her
          work focuses on empowering teachers to use digital tools not just as
          teaching aids, but as bridges to meaningful, accessible learning for
          every student.
        </p>
        <p>
          Building on her education in learning technologies and experience
          designing instructional resources, Nwamaka brings a creative and
          inclusive approach to educational design. She aims to help teachers
          and learners thrive through purpose-driven innovation.

      <h2>My Mission</h2>
      <p>
        To close the digital equity gap in education by giving teachers access
        to tools, strategies, and resources that make technology a pathway to
        opportunity, not a barrier.
